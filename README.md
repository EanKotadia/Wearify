# Wearify-me

Wearify was built as a hackathon project to encourage sustainable shopping habits. However, due to limitations in my skills and React Native, I was unable to fully accomplish the idea. As a result, the project is currently non-functional and inactive, with no ongoing development. It was never intended for real transactions but served as a prototype to explore how technology could drive eco-conscious consumer behavior.

## Features  

- **Sustainable Shopping** – Browse a curated selection of eco-friendly products.  
- **Carbon Savings Tracker** – Users can track how much carbon they have saved.  
- **Admin Panel** – Admins can add new products directly through the app.  
- **Firebase Authentication** – Secure login and user profile system.  
- **Real-Time Firestore Database** – Dynamic product updates without manual refresh.  

## Tech Stack  

- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)  
- **Backend:** Firebase Firestore  
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth  
- **State Management:** React Hooks  
- **Navigation:** React Navigation  
- **Styling:** React Native StyleSheet  

## Purpose  

Wearify was built for a **hackathon** to encourage sustainable shopping habits. While it does not process real transactions, it demonstrates how technology can be used to drive **eco-conscious consumer behavior** through gamification and user engagement.  

## Setup & Installation
